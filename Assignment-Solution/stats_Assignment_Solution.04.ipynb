    "### 1. What is the purpose of the General Linear Model (GLM)?\n",
    "General linear model is a statistical frame-work used to findout the relationship between dependent variable and independent variable. We can use it mostly in linear analysis, Analysis of Variance (ANNOVA), Analysis of Covariance(ANCOVA).\n",
    "\n",
    "It provides flexible approach to analyze and uderstand the relationship betweeen variables\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. What are the key assumptions of the General Linear Model?\n",
    "In GLM the dependent variable suppose to follow the distribution (normal, binomial, poisson)\n",
    "\n",
    "There should be a linear relationship between the dependent variable and independent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indepandence -> All the opbervations in the dataset should be independent of each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Homosedacity -> Error term should showcase a constant variance. It should not be same across all the distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normality -> error or residuals should follow a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "No Multicolinearity -> There should not be any relation between X and X means feature and feature. All the features should be independent to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "No Exdinity -> Excoginity term defines that there is a relation between residual and feature aor residual or label. There should not be any correlation between residual and feature or label.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. How do you interpret the coefficients in a GLM?\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Coefficient Sign:\n",
    "The sign (+ or -) of the coefficient indicates the direction of the relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable. A positive coefficient indicates a positive relationship, meaning that an increase in the independent variable is associated with an increase in the dependent variable. Conversely, a negative coefficient indicates a negative relationship, where an increase in the independent variable is associated with a decrease in the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Magnitude:\n",
    "The magnitude of the coefficient reflects the size of the effect that the independent variable has on the dependent variable, all else being equal. Larger coefficient values indicate a stronger influence of the independent variable on the dependent variable. For example, if the coefficient for a variable is 0.5, it means that a one-unit increase in the independent variable is associated with a 0.5-unit increase (or decrease, depending on the sign) in the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Statistical Significance:\n",
    "The statistical significance of a coefficient is determined by its p-value. A low p-value (typically less than 0.05) suggests that the coefficient is statistically significant, indicating that the relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable is unlikely to occur by chance. On the other hand, a high p-value suggests that the coefficient is not statistically significant, meaning that the relationship may not be reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Adjusted vs. Unadjusted Coefficients:\n",
    "In some cases, models with multiple independent variables may include adjusted coefficients. These coefficients take into account the effects of other variables in the model. Adjusted coefficients provide a more accurate estimate of the relationship between a specific independent variable and the dependent variable, considering the influences of other predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. What is the difference between a univariate and multivariate GLM?\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Univariate GLM:\n",
    "\n",
    "In a GLM model if we are checking the distribution of a single column and analysing the individual features, it is called Univariate GLM.\n",
    "\n",

    "If for a GLM model predictors we are having categorical values then we can encode them with numerical values. using varioustechniques like\n",
    "\n",
    "One hot encoding\n",
    "Binary encoding\n",
    "### What is the purpose of the design matrix in a GLM?\n",
    "The design matrix, also known as the model matrix or feature matrix, is a crucial component of the General Linear Model (GLM). It is a structured representation of the independent variables in the GLM, organized in a matrix format. The design matrix serves the purpose of encoding the relationships between the independent variables and the dependent variable, allowing the GLM to estimate the coefficients and make predictions. Here's the purpose of the design matrix in the GLM:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Encoding Independent Variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "The design matrix represents the independent variables in a structured manner. Each column of the matrix corresponds to a specific independent variable, and each row corresponds to an observation or data point. The design matrix encodes the values of the independent variables for each observation, allowing the GLM to incorporate them into the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Incorporating Nonlinear Relationships:\n",
    "\n",
    "The design matrix can include transformations or interactions of the original independent variables to capture nonlinear relationships between the predictors and the dependent variable. For example, polynomial terms, logarithmic transformations, or interaction terms can be included in the design matrix to account for nonlinearities or interactions in the GLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Handling Categorical Variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "Categorical variables need to be properly encoded to be included in the GLM. The design matrix can handle categorical variables by using dummy coding or other encoding schemes. Dummy variables are binary variables representing the categories of the original variable. By encoding categorical variables appropriately in the design matrix, the GLM can incorporate them in the model and estimate the corresponding coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Estimating Coefficients:\n",
    "\n",
    "The design matrix allows the GLM to estimate the coefficients for each independent variable. By incorporating the design matrix into the GLM's estimation procedure, the model determines the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable, estimating the magnitude and significance of the effects of each predictor.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Making Predictions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the GLM estimates the coefficients, the design matrix is used to make predictions for new, unseen data points. By multiplying the design matrix of the new data with the estimated coefficients, the GLM can generate predictions for the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How do you test the significance of predictors in a GLM?\n",
    "We can test the significance of predictors in GLM by statistical methods\n",
    "\n",
    "The statistical significance of a coefficient is determined by its p-value. A low p-value (typically less than 0.05) suggests that the coefficient is statistically significant, indicating that the relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable is unlikely to occur by chance.

    "### What is the difference between ridge regression and ordinary least squares regression?\n",
    "We use ridge regression to reduce the overfitting of the model. In the formula for ridge regression we add a penalty term with the cost function which brings the value near to zero but not exactly zero because here we are adding the lambda value with slope-squared. The squareed value of slope forms a convex shape every time so we never go to zero, it'll be always near to zero and overfitting get reduced.\n",

    "Categorical Cross-Entropy is used for multi-class classification problems, where there are more than two classes. It measures the difference between the predicted probabilities across multiple classes and the true class labels.\n",

    "### What is the difference between a convex and non-convex loss function?\n",
    "Convexity is a property that can be observed in loss functions, and it has important implications in optimization algorithms. A loss function is considered convex if the second derivative (or Hessian matrix) is positive semi-definite, meaning that the curvature of the function is always non-negative. This property ensures that any local minimum of the loss function is also the global minimum. Convex loss functions play a crucial role in optimization problems as they guarantee the existence of a unique global minimum.\n",

    "\n",
    "Absolute loss, also known as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), measures the average of the absolute differences between the predicted and true values. It treats all errors equally, regardless of their magnitude, making it less sensitive to outliers compared to squared loss. Absolute loss is less influenced by extreme values and is more robust in the presence of outliers.\n",

    "\n",
    "+ Imbalanced Data:\n",
    "In scenarios with imbalanced datasets, where the number of instances in different classes is disproportionate, specialized loss functions can be employed to address the class imbalance. These include:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Weighted Cross-Entropy: This loss function assigns different weights to each class to account for the imbalanced distribution. It upweights the minority class to ensure its contribution is not overwhelmed by the majority class.\n",
    "Example: In fraud detection, where the number of fraudulent transactions is typically much smaller than non-fraudulent ones, weighted cross-entropy can be used to give more weight to the minority class (fraudulent transactions) and improve model performance.\n",
    "\n",

    "In some cases, specific problem requirements or domain knowledge may necessitate the development of custom loss functions tailored to the problem at hand. Custom loss functions allow the incorporation of specific metrics, constraints, or optimization goals into the learning process.\n",

    "### Explain the concept of regularization in the context of loss functions.\n",
    "Regularization is a technique used in machine learning to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization ability of a model. It introduces additional constraints or penalties to the loss function, encouraging the model to learn simpler patterns and avoid overly complex or noisy representations. Regularization helps strike a balance between fitting the training data well and avoiding overfitting, thereby improving the model's performance on unseen data. Here are two common types of regularization techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ L1 Regularization (Lasso Regularization):\n",
    "L1 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the absolute values of the model's coefficients. It encourages the model to set some of the coefficients to exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection and creating sparse models. L1 regularization can be represented as:\n",

It encourages the model to select only the most important features while shrinking the coefficients of less relevant features to zero. This helps in feature selection and avoids overfitting by reducing the model's complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ L2 Regularization (Ridge Regularization):\n",
    "L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the model's coefficients.

    "\n",
    "Both L1 and L2 regularization techniques involve a hyperparameter λ (lambda) that controls the strength of the regularization. A higher value of λ increases the regularization effect, shrinking the coefficients more aggressively and reducing the model's complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization techniques can also be applied to other machine learning models, such as logistic regression, support vector machines (SVMs), and neural networks, to improve their generalization performance and prevent overfitting. The choice between L1 and L2 regularization depends on the specific problem, the nature of the features, and the desired behavior of the model. Regularization is a valuable tool to regularize models and find the right balance between model complexity and generalization.\n",

    "### What is the difference between squared loss and absolute loss?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "Squared loss and absolute loss are two commonly used loss functions in regression problems. They measure the discrepancy or error between predicted values and true values, but they differ in terms of their properties and sensitivity to outliers. Here's an explanation of the differences between squared loss and absolute loss with examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Squared Loss (Mean Squared Error):\n",
    "\n",
    "Squared loss, also known as Mean Squared Error (MSE), calculates the average of the squared differences between the predicted and true values. It penalizes larger errors more severely due to the squaring operation. The squared loss function is differentiable and continuous, which makes it well-suited for optimization algorithms that rely on gradient-based techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, the squared loss is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "Loss(y, ŷ) = (1/n) * ∑(y - ŷ)^2\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a simple regression problem to predict house prices based on the square footage. If the true price of a house is \n",
    "350,000, the squared loss would be (300,000 - 350,000)^2 = 25,000,000. The larger squared difference between the predicted and true values results in a higher loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Absolute Loss (Mean Absolute Error):\n",
    "\n",
    "Absolute loss, also known as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), measures the average of the absolute differences between the predicted and true values. It treats all errors equally, regardless of their magnitude, making it less sensitive to outliers compared to squared loss. Absolute loss is less influenced by extreme values and is more robust in the presence of outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, the absolute loss is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "Loss(y, ŷ) = (1/n) * ∑|y - ŷ|\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the same house price prediction example, if the true price of a house is \n",
    "350,000, the absolute loss would be |300,000 - 350,000| = 50,000. The absolute difference between the predicted and true values is directly considered without squaring it, resulting in a lower loss compared to squared loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Comparison:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Sensitivity to Errors: Squared loss penalizes larger errors more severely due to the squaring operation, while absolute loss treats all errors equally, regardless of their magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Sensitivity to Outliers: Squared loss is more sensitive to outliers because the squared differences amplify the impact of extreme values. Absolute loss is less sensitive to outliers as it only considers the absolute differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Differentiability: Squared loss is differentiable, making it suitable for gradient-based optimization algorithms. Absolute loss is not differentiable at zero, which may require specialized optimization techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Robustness: Absolute loss is more robust to outliers and can provide more robust estimates in the presence of extreme values compared to squared loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice between squared loss and absolute loss depends on the specific problem, the characteristics of the data, and the desired properties of the model. Squared loss is commonly used in many regression tasks, while absolute loss is preferred when robustness to outliers is a priority or when the distribution of errors is known to be asymmetric."

    "### What is an optimizer and what is its purpose in machine learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning, an optimizer is an algorithm or method used to adjust the parameters of a model in order to minimize the loss function or maximize the objective function. Optimizers play a crucial role in training machine learning models by iteratively updating the model's parameters to improve its performance. They determine the direction and magnitude of the parameter updates based on the gradients of the loss or objective function. Here are a few examples of optimizers used in machine learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Gradient Descent:\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient Descent is a popular optimization algorithm used in various machine learning models. It iteratively adjusts the model's parameters in the direction opposite to the gradient of the loss function. It continuously takes small steps towards the minimum of the loss function until convergence is achieved. There are different variants of gradient descent, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):\n",
    "\n",
    "This variant randomly samples a subset of the training data (a batch) in each iteration, making the updates more frequent but with higher variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mini-Batch Gradient Descent: This variant combines the benefits of SGD and batch gradient descent by using a mini-batch of data for each parameter update.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Adam:\n",
    "\n",
    "Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation) is an adaptive optimization algorithm that combines the benefits of both adaptive learning rates and momentum. It adjusts the learning rate for each parameter based on the estimates of the first and second moments of the gradients. Adam is widely used and performs well in many deep learning applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. RMSprop:\n",
    "\n",
    "RMSprop (Root Mean Square Propagation) is an adaptive optimization algorithm that maintains a moving average of the squared gradients for each parameter. It scales the learning rate based on the average of recent squared gradients, allowing for faster convergence and improved stability, especially in the presence of sparse gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Adagrad:\n",
    "\n",
    "Adagrad (Adaptive Gradient Algorithm) is an adaptive optimization algorithm that adapts the learning rate for each parameter based on their historical gradients. It assigns larger learning rates for infrequent parameters and smaller learning rates for frequently updated parameters. Adagrad is particularly useful for sparse data or problems with varying feature frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. LBFGS:\n",
    "\n",
    "LBFGS (Limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno) is a popular optimization algorithm that approximates the Hessian matrix, which represents the second derivatives of the loss function. It is a memory-efficient alternative to methods that explicitly compute or approximate the Hessian matrix, making it suitable for large-scale optimization problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just a few examples of optimizers commonly used in machine learning. Each optimizer has its strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of optimizer depends on factors such as the problem at hand, the size of the dataset, the nature of the model, and computational considerations. Experimentation and tuning are often required to find the most effective optimizer for a given task."

    "\n",
    "One common approach is to assign different weights to the classes during training. This adjusts the importance of each class in the optimization process and helps SVM give more attention to the minority class. The weights are typically inversely proportional to the class frequencies in the training set.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "In scikit-learn library, SVM classifiers have a class_weight parameter that can be set to \"balanced\". This automatically adjusts the class weights based on the training set's class frequencies.\n",

    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) is a popular oversampling technique. It generates synthetic samples by interpolating between existing minority class samples. This expands the minority class and reduces the class imbalance.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Undersampling:\n",
    "\n",
    "Undersampling the majority class involves reducing its representation in the training set by randomly removing samples. This helps to balance the class distribution and prevent the classifier from being biased towards the majority class.

    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "The combination of SMOTE and Tomek links is a popular technique. SMOTE oversamples the minority class while Tomek links identifies and removes any overlapping instances between the minority and majority classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Adjusting Decision Threshold:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, adjusting the decision threshold can be useful for balancing the prediction outcomes. By setting a lower threshold for the minority class, the classifier becomes more sensitive to the minority class and can make more accurate predictions for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "In SVM, the decision threshold is typically set at 0. By lowering the threshold to a negative value, the classifier can make predictions for the minority class more easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that the choice of handling unbalanced datasets depends on the specific problem, the available data, and the performance requirements. It is recommended to carefully evaluate the impact of different approaches and select the one that improves the model's performance on the minority class while maintaining good overall performance."

    "\n",
    "+ Imputation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Another approach is to impute missing values with a suitable estimate. Imputation replaces missing values with a substituted value based on statistical techniques or domain knowledge. Common imputation methods include mean imputation, median imputation, mode imputation, or regression imputation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "If the \"age\" attribute has missing values in a dataset for predicting customer churn, you can impute the missing values with the mean or median age of the available data. This ensures that no data instances are excluded due to missing values and allows the decision tree to use the imputed values for the splitting process.\n",

    "+ Predictive Imputation:\n",
    "\n",
    "For more advanced scenarios, you can use a predictive model to impute missing values. Instead of using a simple statistical estimate, you train a separate model to predict missing values based on other available attributes. This can provide more accurate imputations and capture the relationships among variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "If the \"income\" attribute has missing values in a dataset for predicting customer creditworthiness, you can train a regression model using other attributes such as education, occupation, and credit history to predict the missing income values. The predicted income values can then be used in the decision tree for making accurate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Splitting Based on Missingness:\n",
    "In some cases, missing values can be considered as a separate attribute and used as a criterion for splitting. This approach creates a branch in the decision tree specifically for missing values, allowing the model to capture the relationship between missingness and the target variable.\n",

    "\n",
    "If the \"employment status\" attribute has missing values in a dataset for predicting loan default, you can create a separate branch in the decision tree for the missing values. This branch can represent the scenario where employment status is unknown, enabling the model to capture the impact of missingness on the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling missing values in decision trees requires careful consideration of the dataset and the problem context. The chosen approach should align with the nature of the missingness and aim to minimize bias and information loss. It is important to evaluate the impact of different techniques and select the one that improves the model's performance and generalizability."

    "Pruning is a technique used in decision trees to reduce overfitting and improve the model's generalization performance. It involves the removal or simplification of specific branches or nodes in the tree that may be overly complex or not contributing significantly to the overall predictive power. Pruning helps prevent the decision tree from becoming too specific to the training data, allowing it to better generalize to unseen data. Here's an explanation of the concept of pruning in decision trees:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Overfitting in Decision Trees:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees have the tendency to become overly complex and capture noise or irrelevant patterns in the training data. This phenomenon is known as overfitting, where the tree fits the training data too closely and fails to generalize well to new, unseen data. Overfitting can result in poor predictive performance and reduced model interpretability.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Pre-Pruning and Post-Pruning:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Pruning techniques can be categorized into two main types: pre-pruning and post-pruning.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Pre-Pruning: Pre-pruning involves stopping the growth of the decision tree before it reaches its maximum potential. It imposes constraints or conditions during the tree construction process to prevent overfitting. Pre-pruning techniques include setting a maximum depth for the tree, requiring a minimum number of samples per leaf, or imposing a threshold on impurity measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Post-Pruning: Post-pruning involves building the decision tree to its maximum potential and then selectively removing or collapsing certain branches or nodes. This is done based on specific criteria or statistical measures that determine the relevance or importance of a branch or node. Post-pruning techniques include cost-complexity pruning (also known as minimal cost-complexity pruning or weakest link pruning) and reduced error pruning.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Cost-Complexity Pruning:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cost-complexity pruning is a commonly used post-pruning technique. It involves calculating a cost-complexity parameter (often denoted as alpha) that balances the simplicity of the tree (number of nodes) with its predictive accuracy (ability to fit the training data). The decision tree is then pruned by iteratively removing branches or nodes that increase the overall complexity beyond a certain threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Pruning Process:\n",
    "\n",
    "The pruning process typically involves the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Starting with the fully grown decision tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Calculating the cost-complexity measure for each subtree.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Iteratively removing the subtree with the smallest cost-complexity measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Assessing the impact of pruning on a validation dataset or through cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stopping the pruning process when further pruning leads to a decrease in model performance or when a desired level of simplicity is achieved."

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Predicted Classes: Decision boundaries separate the feature space into regions associated with different predicted classes or outcomes. By observing the decision boundaries, you can understand how the decision tree partitions the feature space to assign specific classes to different regions.\n",

    "+ Decision Rules: Decision boundaries represent the conditions or decision rules that determine the path followed by each data point in the decision tree. These rules can be interpreted to gain insights into the decision-making process and understand how the tree classifies or predicts outcomes based on different feature values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "+ Predictive Accuracy: The position and shape of decision boundaries can give an indication of the predictive accuracy of the decision tree.
