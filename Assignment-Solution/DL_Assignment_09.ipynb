As a result, the parameter updates become too large, causing the optimization process to become unstable.

    "Several techniques can help mitigate the exploding gradient problem:\n",

    "Gradient Clipping: Gradient clipping is a technique that limits the magnitude of the gradients during training. By setting a maximum threshold for the gradients, it prevents them from exceeding a certain value. This helps stabilize the optimization process and prevents the exploding gradient problem.

Initializing the weights of the network using techniques such as Xavier or He initialization can help ensure that the initial gradients are not too large. Careful initialization of weights can lead to more stable training and mitigate gradient explosion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use of Activation Functions: Choosing appropriate activation functions can help mitigate the exploding gradient problem. Activation functions that have gradients that do not tend to explode, such as ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), are preferred over activation functions with gradients that may amplify during backpropagation, such as sigmoid or tanh. ReLU and its variants can help alleviate the gradient explosion by preventing the uncontrolled growth of gradients.\n",
